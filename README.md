## Problem to solve
  [Philip Morris International - Cigarette-butts free world]
Every year millions of (Legal Age) Smokers are throwing away cigarette butts on the ground – trashing our beaches, parks and streets. There is something that needs to be done, if not, in 10 years there may be more cigarette butts in the World than fish. PMI Poland is asking you to join the forces in solving that butt littering problem which is touching all EU countries therefore we are looking for Global solution.
Let’s create the biggest and the most impactful solution ever which helps us to create a movement to end cigarette butt litter. Be part of the environmental change, create a solution how to clean the World from butts which will be applicable for all EU countries, starting in Poland!
## Short description of my solution
Cigarette butts thrown into the public spaces such as parks and beaches pose an environmental threat. Even though the public awareness about environmental issues is tried to be increased, being aware of it is not eliminating the existing problems only by itself. Encouraging the people in different ways in order to beat existing pollution and prevent further pollution will enable faster and more effective results. It will be an adventage to use different methods so as to encourage not only the people who smoke but also the ones who do not.
The people who smoke are the main causes of those trashes, so these group of people need a special solution which will give them a reason to not to throw their butt away. A little bit of personal profit will work to change those bad personal habits. By using an app which will be created for the people who smoke, users will have 10% discount on any cigarette packs which they prefer by returning all of the cigarette butts in their cigarette pack. It is aimed to make people who smoke avoid to throw away their cigarette butts on the floor by this application which encourages collecting cigarette butts directly by the consumer. Accounts can be created in web aplications and it provides the data of the returned butts to be processed so the consumers can use this 10% of discount whenever they wish. 
On the other hand, people who do not smoke can also take part in solving butt littering problem as well as getting an additional profit for themselves by using the app. ''Cigarette butt automats'' which will be placed in spesific points in public spaces such as parks and beaches can be quite helpful in combating problems related to cigarette waste. By downloading the mobile app, users can create their own accounts and after verifying their identity from the automat, collected butts are thrown into the automat. After the automat analyses the weight and the number of the butts, credits will be charged on the accounts. The users who will be collected enough credits can use those credits on shopping from specific shops on specific products.
